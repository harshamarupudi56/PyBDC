# Python Breast Dosage Calculator: PyBDC 1.0
Python toolkit for calculating dosage for breast CT.\
The following software enables accurate dose estimation for one or various breast exposures specifically for breast CT. This tool is a GUI software that can be used on Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. The mode is further explained below along with an overview of the methods, how to choose a method, the program inputs and buttons, the incident spectrum format, images of the GUI, and the accompanying data files.
